            <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 24px; margin-top: 15px;">Electronics and telecommunications engineering is a modern engineering discipline that deals with designing, fabricating, producing, testing and supervising the manufacturing process of complex electronic products and systems. It is a diverse field that encompasses designing and developing traditional analogue technology and high-tech digital components. ETE engineers create many of the devices that we use every day, such as mobile phones, television, radio, personal computers and WiFi networks.
                <br>
                Electronics and telecommunications engineering helps design products in various industries, such as telecommunications, radio and television, healthcare, utilities, science and personal technology manufacturing. ETE engineers deal with analogue transmission, digital transmission, video reception, audio and data, basic electronics, microprocessors, digital and analogue communication, integrated circuits, wave progression and satellite communication. The electronics and telecommunications field is rapidly growing and offers many excellent opportunities for skilled professionals.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 24px; margin-top: 15px;">Computer Science Engineering (CSE) is an academic curriculum that combines the fields of Computer Engineering and Computer Science. It is one of the most popular courses among engineering students. CSE is an enthralling and unique innovative subject that encourages students to pursue creativity and technology.
                <br>
                The course covers a wide range of subjects while highlighting the fundamentals of computer programming and networking. Logic, algorithms, abstraction, and computability are only a few of the concepts covered in Computer Science. Including software engineering, networking, distributed databases, information processing, programming languages, and various other topics.
                <br>
                Despite the fact that CSE is one of the engineering specializations, candidates undertaking the curriculum can choose from a variety of other specializations such as telecommunications, web design, computer hardware and software implementation and maintenance, and so on.</p>

            <h1 style="text-align: center;">Mechanical Engineering</h1>
            <img src="mech.jpg" alt="" style="margin-left: auto; display: block; margin-right: auto; height: auto; width: 100%; margin-top: 1rem;">
            <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 24px; margin-top: 15px;">Technically, mechanical engineering is the application of the principles and problem-solving techniques of engineering from design to manufacturing to the marketplace for any object. Mechanical engineers analyze their work using the principles of motion, energy, and force—ensuring that designs function safely, efficiently, and reliably, all at a competitive cost.
                <br>
                Mechanical engineers make a difference. That's because mechanical engineering careers center on creating technologies to meet human needs. Virtually every product or service in modern life has probably been touched in some way by a mechanical engineer to help humankind.
                <br>
                This includes solving today's problems and creating future solutions in health care, energy, transportation, world hunger, space exploration, climate change, and more.
                <br>
                Being ingrained in many challenges and innovations across many fields means a mechanical engineering education is versatile. To meet this broad demand, mechanical engineers may design a component, a machine, a system, or a process. This ranges from the macro to the micro, from the largest systems like cars and satellites to the smallest components like sensors and switches. Anything that needs to be manufactured—indeed, anything with moving parts—needs the expertise of a mechanical engineer. </p>

            <img src="civil.jpg" alt="" style="margin-left: auto; display: block; margin-right: auto; height: auto; width: 100%; margin-top: 1rem;">
            <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 24px; margin-top: 15px;">Civil engineering is a professional engineering discipline that deals with the design, construction, and maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment, including public works such as roads, bridges, canals, dams, airports, sewage systems, pipelines, structural components of buildings, and railways.[1][2]
                <br>
                Civil engineering is traditionally broken into a number of sub-disciplines. It is considered the second-oldest engineering discipline after military engineering,[3] and it is defined to distinguish non-military engineering from military engineering.[4] Civil engineering can take place in the public sector from municipal public works departments through to federal government agencies, and in the private sector from locally based firms to global Fortune 500 companies.
